## Description
The goal of this project is to create an easy to use website where people feel supported from the moment they arrive.  We want to help eliminate the stigma surrounding mental health concerns while providing immediate caring support to those in need.  The primary site goal is to provide a user-friendly method for finding and booking appointments with recommended local therapists.  Additional features will include:
* live text voice and video chat
* personal progress insights
* personalized content suggestions
* more to come

## Intended Users
The target audience of this project is anyone who's seeking peace, happiness, relief.  According to the CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealthsurveillance/">1 in 4 Americans</a> are burdened with a diagnosed mental illness, and that number doesn't reflect the millions of people who would benefit from powerful professional support during times of need.  Anyone who's looking for someone to talk with or any type of resource to help facilitate a more joyous mood would benefit from a comprehensive easy to use platform that provides personalized resources, features to track and improve health and access to professional assistance.
